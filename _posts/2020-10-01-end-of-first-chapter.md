I have been very fortunate to work in my current job as a Cloud Automation Engineer for a leading Azure consultancy and to experience the accelerated growth that only comes from working at such a pace. [10th Magnitude](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/) (we say "10M" internally) is now almost 150 employees, and I was hired when we were still in the 30-40 person range. I have been there for 4 years and have seen immense growth both in my own career, as a company, and as a person. I am so proud of what we built together and that I grew a strong technical foundation there.

I am extremely grateful to my colleagues and CEO, Alex Brown, at 10th Magnitude for taking a chance on me [4 years ago](http://www.anniehedgie.com/leaning-in) and fostering my growth ever since. Every little boost counts when you're onboarding someone new, and I remember everyone who helped along the way. I extend my heartfelt thanks. These past 4 years have been some of the best of my life, and I will hold the memories dear. I would not be where I am today without 10M.

Alas, while I was eager to see 10M and the team I manage through a successful transition to [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/) and to help build a strong Microsoft Business Group, a job posting came across my radar that looked so perfect for me, almost like it was written for me. On a hopeful whim, I applied, interviewed, and then accepted an offer as a Software Engineer on the [Terraform Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html) team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) focusing on building a platform that enables infrastructure testing and CI/CD, building automation that runs tests and manages its infrastructure. When I saw [`kitchen-terraform`](http://www.anniehedgie.com/kitchen-terraform-and-inspec) knowledge as a qualification in the job posting, I was sold. (I may have told one or two of the interview panel that I gave a [HashiTalk](https://youtu.be/q1Vx02N1_vo) on that this year.)

This new position so perfectly lines up with my career objectives as I've been wanting to move into software development while leveraging my existing skills, which was a challenging feat at 10M since my role had little exposure to software opportunities. It is really satisfying that I will get to see my goals to fruition.

I start at HashiCorp on October 12, and I am over the moon. I cannot wait to get started with this team of extremely talented engineers! (Thank you, TFE team, for letting me join your ranks!) As one really beautiful chapter ends, another very exciting one begins.
