If you've read [The Phoenix Project](http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) (you know, the DevOps novel), then you'll know what I mean when I say that I'm a bit of a Patty type - [art background but having something to contribute to the IT world](http://www.anniehedgie.com/introduction), just trying to figure out how. So I think the best thing to do is network as much as I can and keep doing projects to find my niche. So far so good - I'm liking it more than I thought I would, honestly. The more small, manageable experiences that I have in the IT world, the less scary and ethereal it seems to me.  

When I tell people in my world what I'm doing (re: learning tech stuff), they look at me like I'm crazy, [like I'm not being true to myself](https://youtu.be/BjhxLYD89X8), as if to say, "But Annie, you're so creative. Why are you selling out?" But that's just it, isn't it? The world has the message that technology isn't for creative-fuzzy-right-brained types. But it is! When I think about the flexibility and fluidity that is required of organizations employing DevOps practices, I'm convinced that it takes all types of people. 

So one day I was reading this blog post by Doug Ireton about [encouraging women in DevOps](http://dougireton.com/blog/2013/06/23/encouraging-women-in-dev-slash-ops/) (so good!), and his last point was that the DevOps Days conferences need more women to help run them. So being the doer that I am, I landed myself in the middle of planning for [DevOps Days Dallas](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-dallas/) in September. I'm excited to get to meet so many people and learn about companies that are movin' and shakin' in the IT world. 

My jobs will be working with sponsors/vendors and throwing a very happy happy-hour, so shout out if you plan to go! And if your company wants to sponsor, all the better! Go here and [check out all of the sponsorship levels](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-dallas/sponsor/).

Hope to see you there!
