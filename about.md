I am currently a Senior Engineer on the Terraform Enterprise team at HashiCorp. In this role, I'm a bit of a Jane of all trades, including Go development for Terraform Enterprise services, creating workflows in GitHub Actions, building and deploying Docker images, and using the heck of Terraform core, Terraform Cloud, and Terraform Enterprise. My goal in whatever I do is to make the right thing to do the easy thing to do, whether that's creating an extensible Go package or creating a workflow that others can easily use from the UI. Empathy for both the end user and the developers that come after me is always top of mind.

When I started this role, I built out a lot of automation that runs tests and manages its infrastructure, creating workflows, scripts and frameworks that enable developers to run tests themselves. My first goal was to increase quality and reduce risk when releasing our software. And my second goal was to enable developers to better understand our systemsâ€™ scalability and performance characteristics at a deeper level.

Previously, I was very forturnate to a Senior Cloud Automation Engineer at [10th Magnitude](https://www.10thmagnitude.com/), where I focused on accelerating Azure cloud adoption through automation and DevOps. I was able to experience the accelerated growth that only comes from working at such a pace. I was there for 4 years and saw immense growth both in my own career, as a company, and as a person. I am so proud of what we built together and that I grew a strong technical foundation there.

But before that, I started my career as a [casting director](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1805484/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) after getting a degree in film. I love to see how what I learned in the arts helps me every day bring people together under a common idea and vision and how the arts have helped me with the grit and determination to overcome any obstacle facing me. The collaboration, inspiration, and mentorship that I get from the DevOps community, and my husband who is a leader in DevOps, is undeniably linked to my success.
